\begin{abstract}
    In the automotive industry, suppliers aim to increase their revenue and try
    to keep up with the pace of the market trends to stay competitive by
    offering off-the-shelf products to car manufacturers. On the other hand
    those car manufacturers request tailored products to gain unique selling
    points. Each new customer request may result in a new software project. To
    save time one might find it a good idea to create the new software project
    as a copy of an older one. This method guarantees initial functionality, but
    prevents refactoring and leads to continuous software erosion. The
    implementations diverge from each other and improvements cannot be shared.
    Software Product Lines (SPL) can help to maximize reusability and quality by
    building up shared core assets and customer-specific functionality. In our
    paper, we propose a method to migrate a customer project landscape into a
    scalable SPL in three steps.
