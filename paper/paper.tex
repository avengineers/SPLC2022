\begin{abstract}
    As with every business, being profitable does not ensure to remain
    competitive in the future. A competitive advantage requires a fast adaption
    to the market, to the regulations and customer needs. In the automotive
    industry, suppliers aim to increase their revenue and try to keep up with
    the pace of the market trends to stay competitive by offering off-the-shelf
    products to car manufacturers (also called original equipment manufacturers,
    OEMs), whereas the OEMs themselves request tailored products to gain unique
    selling points. Each new customer project may result in a new software
    project. To save time one might find it a good idea to create the new
    software project as a copy of an older one. Starting a new software project
    based on another one guarantees initial functionality, but prevents
    refactoring and leads to continuous software erosion. The implementations
    diverge from each other and improvements cannot be shared in all customer
    projects. Software Product Lines (SPL) can help to maximize reusability and
    quality by building up shared core assets and customer-specific
    functionality. However, migrating active projects into an SPL can be a risky
    task due to release schedules. The migration is especially risky if a big
    bang transition is the only option. In our paper, we propose a method to
    migrate a customer project landscape into a scalable SPL in three steps: (1)
    \textit{Complexity Reduction} by reorganizing the multiple repositories
    (polyrepo) to a single repository (monorepo) with a new build system, (2)
    \textit{Modularization} by building up core assets and making them
    configurable, (3) \textit{Versioned Dependency Management} to allow reuse of
    versioned components across our product portfolio. This migration is
    possible in everyone's own pace \textendash{} incrementally, iteratively and
    decentrally.
